## Introduction ##

During the start of the year throughout semester 2, the global situation caused by COVID-19 has resulted in a lot of changes in the curriculum and the assessment method. One problem that we as students faced was the numerous **updates and changes** in our assignments method, as well as the changes in our exam **deadlines and assignment due dates**. As such it was frustrating for us to respond and react to the many changes, especially when the announcements appeared on **different platforms** such as Luminus, email, SMS etc.

## Problem Motivation ##

We face many assignments and deadlines in school. Sometimes this can be confusing especially when there are numerous platforms that we can receive such notifications (emails, texts, sch websites)

## Tech Stack ##

### React Native ###
We decided with React-native as there are numerous packages and libraries that are readily available for us to use. In addition to it being advantageous in building a cross platform mobile application, many online guides and tutorials can be easily sourced due to its popularity.

### Firebase ###
We decided with firebase as our backend database due to its real time data synchronization and the storage and queries of datas  using them are relatively easy to learn and use. Its packages in relation to react-native are relatively easy to pick up and use as well.
